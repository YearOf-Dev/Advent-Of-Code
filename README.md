![Advent of Code, Multilanguage Challenge](/.gitlab/assets/headers/repo.png)

This repository contains the code for solutions and result data for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com). As part of the [YearOf.Dev](https://yearof.dev) challenge, I am attempting every year of the challenge in Typescript, Golang, Python and Rust.

## Results

| Year | Starts |

## Languages

Alongside the actual challenges, I am testing how long the implementation takes in each language. I do this is three parts:
- The time it takes to run the part 1 function
- The time it takes to run the part 2 function
- The time it takes to read the input, and run both functions

All of this is measured either by dedicated performance metrics built into the language, or by taking timestamps of start and end and calculating the difference. This is recorded in Nanoseconds. Each challenge has a winner and a loser for each of these three parts.

| Language | Wins | Losses |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Typescript | 4 | 2 |
| Go | 3 | 2 |
| Python | 2 | 5 |
| Rust | 5 | 9 |
